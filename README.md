Kokki is a system configuration management framework styled after Chef.

It is currently in major development so you shouldn't use it in
production. I must admit though that I am. I just can't recommend that
anyone else does.

Q. Why Kokki? Why not Chef or Puppet?

A. The main reason is because I prefer Python to Ruby. Really it only took a weekend to get most of Kokki done.. so why not?
