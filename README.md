Q. Why Kokki? Why not Chef or Puppet?

A. The main reason is because I prefer Python to Ruby. Really it only took a weekend to get most of Kokki done.. so why not?

Q. Why the name Kokki?

A. Kokki means "cook" in Finnish. The word for Chef is keitti√∂mestari (kitchen master) which is a bit too long for a project name.
